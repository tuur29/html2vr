# HTML2VR Browser extensions

Extension currently supports Chrome and Firefox.

## Releases

Unfortunately Chrome and Firefox don't allow users to install extensions manually and this project hasn't matured enough to be published to the Official extension storefronts.

You can however temporarily install the extension to test it by following these steps:

- [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#manifest)
- [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox)
